# hono-worker

## Note
I wanna create static site in cloudflare worker, so I adopted [hono](https://hono.dev/) framework, learning day by day. At last, I am going to rewrite [kishax-web](https://github.com/verazza/kishax-web) with hono.

## deploy
- cloudflare  
see [https://verazza.work/](https://verazza.work/)
